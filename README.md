# Auto-Adjusting-Data-Processing-Per-Data-Conditioning
Auto-Adjusting Data Processing Per Data Conditioning Daen690 Capstone Project

When working on any project which involves working extensively with data, the process of data quality check is a labour-intensive, time consuming and extensive manual effort requiring task. The purpose of this project is to minimize time and effort spent on assessing data for errors and inconsistencies.


Information about the folders:
• The File Type Detector folder contains a script for detecting the data type of the input.
• Structured Metadata folders contain script for extracting metadata from structured data such as frequency counts, embedded image check, free form text check and so on.
• Unstructured Image folder contains scripts to extract metadata from images such as objects in the image, image noise check, image format, image size and so on.
• The Final Code & Output contains the script which concatenates all the above-mentioned scripts into a single script ready for use.


Steps to do data profiling on your data:
• Download any csv, excel or image files.
• Download the Data_Profiling_Complete.ipynb file.
• Run the Data_Profiling_Complete.ipynb file while providing the input as the data you initially downloaded.
• Now you can see the output as a html, showing all the anomalies and providing recommendations.
